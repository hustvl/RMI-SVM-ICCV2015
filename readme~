This is the MATLAB code for "RMI-SVM", which jointly optimizes the bag-level label and instance-level label for Multiple Instance Learning problem. Please refer to "Relaxed Multiple-Instance SVM With Application to Object Discovery" for details and discussions. Note that the results can be different for every running since we adopt the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm to solve the problem.
